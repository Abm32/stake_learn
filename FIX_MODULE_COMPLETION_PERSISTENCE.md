# Module Completion Progress Persistence - FIXED ✅

## Issue
Module completion progress was not persisting after page refresh. When a user completed a module, it would show as completed temporarily, but after refreshing the page, it would revert back to "Complete Module" instead of showing "Completed".

## Root Cause
The API route (`apps/web/app/api/progress/route.ts`) had an **early return statement** in the mock transaction path that was exiting the function BEFORE saving the progress to storage.

### The Problem Code
```typescript
if (!dataCoinContractAddress || ...) {
  const reward = { ... };
  
  return NextResponse.json({
    success: true,
    reward,
    message: `Awarded ${rewardAmount} DataCoins...`
  });
  // ❌ Function exits here - progress save code below was NEVER reached!
}

// This code was never executed because of early return above
if (moduleId && totalModules && courseId) {
  // Save progress logic...
}
```

## Solution
Moved the progress save logic BEFORE the return statement, so it executes in both mock and real minting paths.

### Fixed Code Structure
```typescript
if (!dataCoinContractAddress || ...) {
  const reward = { ... };
  
  // ✅ Save progress BEFORE returning
  if (moduleId && totalModules && courseId) {
    // Save progress to storage
    progressStorage.set(key, existingProgress);
  }
  
  return NextResponse.json({
    success: true,
    reward,
    message: `Awarded ${rewardAmount} DataCoins...`
  });
}
```

## Changes Made

### File: `apps/web/app/api/progress/route.ts`

1. **Added progress save logic in mock transaction path** (lines 76-127)
   - Checks if `moduleId`, `totalModules`, and `courseId` are provided
   - Retrieves existing progress or initializes new progress structure
   - Updates the specific module as completed
   - Recalculates `completedModules` and `progressPercentage`
   - Saves to `global.progressStorage`

2. **Kept progress save logic in real minting path** (lines 163-214)
   - Same logic for when DataCoin contract is configured

3. **Removed duplicate/unreachable code**
   - Cleaned up debugging logs
   - Removed file system logging

## Testing Results

Tested with multiple module completions:

```
Module 1 completed → Progress: 1/4 (25%) ✅
Module 2 completed → Progress: 2/4 (50%) ✅
Module 3 completed → Progress: 3/4 (75%) ✅
Module 4 completed → Progress: 4/4 (100%) ✅
```

Progress correctly:
- ✅ Persists across page refreshes
- ✅ Accumulates as more modules are completed
- ✅ Shows correct completion status for each module
- ✅ Updates `completedModules` count
- ✅ Updates `progressPercentage`
- ✅ Stores detailed module data (completedAt, rewardEarned, transactionHash)

## Storage Mechanism

Using `global.progressStorage` (Map) to persist data across API requests:

```typescript
declare global {
  var progressStorage: Map<string, any> | undefined;
}

if (!global.progressStorage) {
  global.progressStorage = new Map<string, any>();
}

const progressStorage = global.progressStorage;
```

**Key format**: `${userAddress}-${courseId}`

**Value format**:
```typescript
{
  courseId: number,
  totalModules: number,
  completedModules: number,
  progressPercentage: number,
  modules: [
    {
      courseId: number,
      moduleId: number,
      completed: boolean,
      completedAt?: number,
      rewardEarned?: string,
      transactionHash?: string
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

## Notes

- This is an in-memory storage solution suitable for development
- For production, replace with a persistent database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- The `global` variable ensures the Map persists across Next.js API route hot reloads during development
- Progress is stored per user per course

## Status
✅ **FIXED AND TESTED**

The module completion progress now persists correctly after page refresh!
